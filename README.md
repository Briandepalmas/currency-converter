### `MISSION STATEMENT`

The mission of this Currency Converter App is to help travellers know how much something costs in U.S Dollars while using a foreign currency outside of the United Sates. This application can help improve a traveller spending habits by converting the currency of any country into American dollars so they can make a more informed buying decision.

Selector.js holds a "Country" property in the component state and send the country selected to the App.js state "Country" property

## 5 stateless components
The five components will be 5 different countries and will display the countrys flag.
